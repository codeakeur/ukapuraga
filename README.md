Comies is a platform that helps food services and stores organize themselves better. We allow users to sell products, manage stocks, keep track of profit. 

## ðŸ§© Project

### Architecture

As it is intended to make this service increase their capabilities, we used [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) to structure our project. This way, the service functions can grow and change with less possibilities of breaking other parts
